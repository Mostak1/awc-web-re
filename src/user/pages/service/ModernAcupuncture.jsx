                <div className="fs-5 text-muted">
                  Acupuncture is a nearly 2,000-year-old form of traditional
                  Chinese medicine technique in which practitioners stimulate
                  specific points on the body. In acupuncture, thin needles are
                  inserted through the skin at specific points on the body. In
                  combination with conventional treatments, studies indicate
                  acupuncture may be beneficial for several conditions,
                  including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, cancer and
                  treatment-related pain, peripheral neuropathies, dry mouth,
                  hot flashes, fatigue and stress management. Acupuncture may
                  also help ease chronic low-back pain, neck pain, and
                  osteoarthritis/knee pain. It also may help reduce the
                  frequency of tension headaches and prevent migraine headaches.

                  Acupuncture and TCM are extremely successful in treating a
                  variety of disorders, especially those severe and complex
                  conditions which conventional Western medicine lacks of
                  treatment options. Acupuncture can act as a standalone
                  treatment or as an adjunct to other medical treatment forms.
                  Acupuncture is also often used as preventative medicine with a
                  few times a year for a “tune up” or a “balancing” treatment.
                  Our specialties on the disorders treated with acupuncture
                  (including Chinese herbs) focus on:

                <h2 data-aos="fade-left">How does acupuncture work?</h2>
                <div className="fs-5 text-muted">
                  According to the theory of Chinese medicine, the human body is
                  considered as a dynamic organism composed of internal and
                  external organs, connected with channels called meridians.
                  Through these meridians, qi (pronounced chee) or vital energy,
                  is flowing constantly all over the body to support and nourish
                  the organs. Yin and Yang balance is adjusted by the flow of
                  qi. A healthy body requires a free flow of qi, whereas
                  disorders occur when meridians are blocked, and the flow of qi
                  is stopped. Acupuncture is capable of unblocking the
                  meridians, freeing the flow of qi, restoring the balance, and
                  consequently treat the disorders. A considerable amount of
                  scientific research has been conducted to explore mechanisms
                  of acupuncture on physiology and pathophysiology of the human
                  body. For instance: acupuncture stimulates endorphin release
                  to provide pain relief; acupuncture regulates serotonin in the
                  brain to treat emotional disorders; acupuncture improves blood
                  circulation, decreases inflammation, and increases T-cell
                  count to stimulate immune system. Therefore, acupuncture is
                  now more and more accepted by practitioners and patients world
                  wide, including United States.

                  Prior to receiving care, each patient undergoes a thorough
                  history and examination to ensure that acupuncture is
                  warranted. Thereafter, each treatment takes about half an
                  hour, and needles are retained in the body for 10-20 minutes.
                  In some cases, patients are instructed to move certain body
                  parts (with needles in) in order to reinforce qi sensation and
                  achieve maximal results.

                  while they are not hollow with cutting edges. The tip of
                  acupuncture needle is specially made, round and smooth like a
                  pine needle, to minimize the tissue damage during treatment —
                  this is essential to stimulating your body systems. Patients
                  may feel a pinch or sting, followed by some pressure, burning

                  Yes! Use of disposable needles completely eliminates the
                  chance of transmission of infectious diseases through needles.
                  Acupuncturists have passed national Clean Needle Technique
                  examination before being certified by National Certification
                  Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and
                  before being licensed by the state board. For a list of

                  It varies depending on severity of the diseases, conditions of
                  individual and the response to treatments. Generally, chronic
                  or severe problems require several months’ treatment with one
                  or two treatments per week, whereas acute or mild disorders
                  require less time and frequency of treatments. But a positive
                  response to acupuncture treatment is generally evident between
                  the1st and the 4th treatment. For “Wellness Care”, as little
                  as 4 times per year may be necessary. Like other healthcare
                  treatment plans, each acupuncture visit builds upon the
                  treatment before, so following a treatment plan is important
                  to a successful outcome.
